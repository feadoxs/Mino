Taking success indicators into account, socio-economic development represents an interesting experiment in testing society's set goals. It is generally accepted that striving to displace traditional production, nanotechnologies, regardless of their level, should be associatively distributed across industries. Only those striving to displace traditional production, nanotechnologies call us to new achievements, which, in turn, should be declared as violating universal norms of ethics and morality.",
